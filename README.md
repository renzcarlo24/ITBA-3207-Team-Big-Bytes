# Exploratory Data Analysis in Minimizing and Reducing Food Waste

## Introduction


Food waste is one of the global issues that is of great concern to the public. In fact, it has implications for people as well as the environment. Food waste is also considered one of the major contributors to climate change. Food waste is defined as human leftover or foods that have gone bad and foods that have been thrown away for various reasons. Food waste occurs when there is an oversupply in the production, food not being taken before it get expired, or intentionally discarded by the consumers. According to the study of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN, commonly known as FAO, 30% of food produced for human consumption worldwide gets lost or wasted each year, which is equivalent to 1.3 billion tons of food. All food that is not consumed by humans, which eventually goes to waste, specifically dumped in landfills that produces greenhouse gases. For a variety of reasons, some food consumers throw away food that has passed its expiration date or has gone bad before it is consumed, which has sparked several challenges in the modern world, whose impacts can be seen today in economic and environmental sustainability. This is why we should address the food waste issue seriously.

South-East Asia countries have a combined population of almost 667 million people in 2021, accounting for 8.44% of the global population. The home, retail, and food service industries account for the vast majority of food waste. These 3 sectors are the major contributor in terms of food waste. According to UNEP, 931 million tonnes of food are wasted across the three sectors.  The household sector consists of the individuals that live under one roof. In retail industry, this pertains to the businesses that sell goods or foods through stores, while the food service sector refers to any establishments that involved in preparing or selling food to people outside their homes (e.g. restaurants, canteen). 

In the Philippines, the survival food in some parts of Payatas Quezon, practiced Pagpag. This means "shaking off the dirt". This is where they look for resources, especially foods in dumpsters or landfills that could still be eaten. They cook foods found in dumpsters and add seasonings to give a better taste. On the other hand, there are foods that are no longer suitable for human consumption, like if the meat is soft, then it has gone bad already. So, the people in Payatas look for meat that is hard. Instead of dumping excess food into the trash, a better way is to donate it or give it to those in need.  This will address one of the target SDGs of this analysis, which is Zero Hunger. 

The primary goal of this exploratory data analysis is to identify how food wastes can be reduced across the three levels in South-East Asia. Furthermore, the analysts will provide food waste baseline strategies to help the country achieve a sustainable level of food waste reduction. 

## Problem Statement 

**Greenhouse Gasses Emissions from Food Waste.**
The amount of greenhouse gas emissions is 6%, which comes from food waste. The rotten food goes straight into landfills, which produces methane, whereas it is considered stronger than carbon dioxide. 


## Significance of the proposed topic
The key findings of this study may be significant and redound the following entities

**Community.** Foods that are still edible and haven't gone bad can be donated. This will benefit one’s community by providing donated untouched food to individuals who may not have a consistent food supply that would have otherwise gone to waste and landfills. A cruel irony that we must face is that, there are families that go hungry and yet lots of food goes to waste every day. As a result, this data analysis will address effective food preservation in households by giving a strategy and tactics that will be beneficial to individuals in need of food.  

**Government.** The analysis and key findings of this study can be use by any government sectors in reducing waste to achieve sustainable solutions that can be derived from the range of feasible waste management options in this study.


**Future Data Analysts.** The findings of this study can be used as a foundation for future studies by other researchers. 


## Methods

This analysis aims to collect reliable datasets and information that will help researchers gain a deeper understanding in terms of the effects of food waste from different sectors. Most of the datasets came from the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) Report 2021. According to this report, 931 million tonnes each year get wasted from the three sectors, including households, retailers, and food service. The other datasets to be used include the waste proportion, population index, and global hunger index. A correlation matrix will also be present to justify the relationship between various variables. In this analysis, the variables that will be used are: ASEAN GDP, population, household tonnes per year, food service tonnes per year, and retail tonnes per year. Furthermore, Linear Regression Analysis will be employed to show the relationship between variables such as three sectors capita per year and population index. 

## Expected Output
    
The goal of this project is to provide a clear visualization in able to better analyze the amount of food production made by the countries in Southeast Asia. The data collected targets to show how massive the total numbers of food waste was made per year and how this contributes to global hunger. This study is expected to serve as awareness to the community, most especially, to the government, to start minimizing and evaluating the factors that contribute to the continuous increase in the number of food waste. It also aims to achieve responsible food consumption and production to avoid unneccessary food waste.  To to attain zero hunger, the excess produced food that is near to its expiry will be recommended to put and make into good use such as donating it to the less fortunate family or individual before it become a food waste.

## Sustainable Development Goals
The SDG’s below are the target of this project:

**SDG Goal 2: Zero Hunger** 
-This SDG aims to end hunger and ensure that all people, particularly the poor and those in vulnerable situations, including infants, have access to safe, nutritious, and sufficient food throughout the year. (United Nations, n.d.)

**SDG Goal 12: Responsible Consumption and Production** 
-This SDG targets to achieve sustainable management, efficient use of natural resources, and significant waste reduction through waste prevention, reduction, recycling, and reuse. (United Nations, n.d.)

**SDG Goal 12.3: Global Food Loss and Waste** 
-This goal aims to halve food waste and reduce food loss by 2030 alongside with the production and supply chain that includes post-harvest losses. (United Nations, n.d.)
