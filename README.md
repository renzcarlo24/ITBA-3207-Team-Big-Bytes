# A Data-driven Approach to Reduce Food Waste

## Introduction

Food Waste is one of our society's and it is a growing public concern. In fact, it represents a global problem with implications for both people and the environment. Food waste occurs when there is an oversupply in the production, food not being taken before it get expired, or intentionally discarded by the consumers. Food waste exacerbates environmental issues by being a major contributor in climate change, loss of biodiversity and pollution. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN (FAO), roughly 30% of food produced for human consumption worldwide is either lost or wasted each year which is equivalent to 1.3 billion tons of food. It is neccessary to address this issue since food wastes have initiated several challenges in the modern world whose impacts can be seen today in economic, social and environmental sustainability. 

ASEAN countries have a combined population of almost 625 million people, accounting for 8.8% of the global population. According to a survey conducted by Future Directions International (FDI), Southeast Asia accounts for 25% of global food waste. However, food wastes have initiated several challenges not just in Southeast Asia, but in the modern world whose impacts can be seen today in economic, social and environmental sustainability. 

Food wastage occurs at every stage of the food supply chain, from the production, to household, to retail, and consumption. Furthermore, the analysts will provide food waste baseline strategies to help the country achieve a sustainable level of food waste reduction.  

## Problem Statement 

The ongoing rise of food wastes      is very relevant in our times today and this data analysis aims to address it. The main problem in this project is the ineffective interventions in preventing and minimizing food wastes implemented in Southeast Asia. Food waste is common in Southeast Asia, with serious consequences for regional food, environmental, and economic security. The reasons of wasted food along Southeast Asian supply chains are very comparable to those seen elsewhere in the world, however established interventions for preventing and minimizing food waste are not extensively applied. 

## Significance of the proposed topic
The key findings of this study may be significant and redound the following entities

**Community.** Foods that are still edible and haven't gone bad can be donated. This will benefit one’s community by providing donated untouched food to individuals who may not have a consistent food supply that would have otherwise gone to waste and landfills. A cruel irony that we must face is that, there are families that go hungry and yet lots of food goes to waste every day. As a result, this data analysis will address effective food preservation in households by giving a strategy and tactics that will be beneficial to individuals in need of food.  

**Government.** The analysis and key findings of this study can be use by any government sectors in reducing waste to achieve sustainable solutions that can be derived from the range of feasible waste management options in this study.

**Farmer or Agriculturists.** Since the study also cover the food waste that can be converted into organic fertilizers, the plants to be grown in the rich soil will be apparently healthy. Those who grow plants particularly farmers, will find this analysis useful for a quick but secure production of crops through the method of using the food waste as organic fertilizers instead of chemical fertilizers.

**Future Data Analysts.** The findings of this study can be used as a foundation for future studies by other researchers. 


## Methods

**Composting Methodology** - Convert organic waste into fertilizers and soil rich in nutrients. Encourage homes to recycle organic waste. construct cutting-edge facilities for the production of high-quality compost and soil amendments. 

**Plan for Food Rescue** - Extra food should be donated to local social services, and local communities should be supported. Give guidelines for food donation to aid in the recovery and redistribution of safe and edible foods acquire, produce, and redistribute surplus food to low-income communities in collaboration with relevant parties.

**Approach for Animal Feed** – Divert food scraps to feed animals. Anyone can offer food scraps to animals if they are handled properly and safely. Farmers and businesses can save money by feeding scraps to animals. Rather than having food scraps carried to a landfill, it is typically cheaper to feed them to animals. Companies can also give excess food to zoos or animal or pet food manufacturers. Collaboration between appropriate agencies to supply stray animals with nutritious food. 


## Expected Output
    
The goal of this project is to provide a clear visualization in able to better analyze the amount of food production made by the countries in Southeast Asia. The data collected targets to show how massive the total numbers of food waste was made per year and how this contributes to global hunger. This study is expected to serve as awareness to the community, most especially, to the government, to start minimizing and evaluating the factors that contribute to the continuous increase in the number of food waste. It also aims to achieve responsible food consumption and production to avoid unneccessary food waste.  To to attain zero hunger, the excess produced food that is near to its expiry will be recommended to put and make into good use such as donating it to the less fortunate family or individual before it become a food waste.

## Sustainable Development Goals
The SDG’s below are the target of this project: 
    
**SDG Goal 2: Zero Hunger** 
-This SDG aims to end hunger and ensure that all people, particularly the poor and those in vulnerable situations, including infants, have access to safe, nutritious, and sufficient food throughout the year. (United Nations, n.d.)

**SDG Goal 12: Responsible Consumption and Production** 
-This SDG targets to achieve sustainable management, efficient use of natural resources, and significant waste reduction through waste prevention, reduction, recycling, and reuse. (United Nations, n.d.) 
        
**SDG Goal 12.3: Global Food Loss and Waste** 
-This goal aims to halve food waste and reduce food loss by 2030 alongside with the production and supply chain that includes post-harvest losses. (United Nations, n.d.)
